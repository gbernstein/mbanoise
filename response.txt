Response to first referee report.

I thank the referee for their concise and insightful review of the paper.  The
main issue raised is that this paper relies heavily on the companion paper
analysing LSST constraints on asteroid masses from mutual encounters.  That
paper was submitted to PSJ some weeks before this one, and has since been
refereed, revised, accepted, and published in the journal, which I hope will
assuage this worry.

One of the revisions made to that paper addressed an issue also raised by this
referee, which was the rather high value of albedo assumed for the main-belt
asteroid population.  To address this concern for the other paper, we changed
our conversion from (well-observed) H values to (physically relevant) mass
substantially,  Instead of choosing a representative value of  both density and
albedo of the population, we surveyed the literature for individual main-belt
asteroids (MBAs) with mass determinations of any useful precision, then examined
the ratio $M/ 10^{-0.6H}$ directly.  The number of such bodies is actually
larger than the number for which both density and albedo have been determined
to similar precision, so is a simpler and slightly more accurate means of deriving
the "mass-to-light" conversion.  See Figure 1 and Section 2.1 of the published
paper.

The adopted result was that the distribution of mass-to-light
ratios of this (incomplete, heterogeneous, almost certainly biased) population
could be crudely characterized by taking a "high" and "low" value, which differ
by a factor of 5.  The main change made to this Brownian-motion paper is to
adopt these two values and recalculate the resulting integrals that yield the
estimated RMS 10-year uncertainties that are the key result of this paper.
These mass-to-light ratio changes appear as multiplicative scalings of the
previous result.  The thresholds for individually-detectable impulses in Section
3.2.3 have also been updated in concert with the updates to the
mass-determination paper.

Thus the numerical results presented in this paper have been adjusted, but as
per the referee's comments, the methodology remains unchanged.  Changed text is
in red in the draft, and figures that have changed have this noted in their
captions.

A few minor replies to the referee's comments are below.

We did not intend to give the impression that Brownian motion is larger or more
important on decadal scales than over millennia.  Rather our purpose is to
quantify the effect of the Brownian motion on "real-time" dynamics of the solar
system, i.e. the development of ephemerides that fit obervations and adjust
parameters of the solar system's members and of the laws of gravitation.
Understanding the long-term dynamical consequences of the Brownian motion for
population evolution is beyond our scope.
